You are tasked with creating a full-stack buildout plan for a personal web app based on a person's LinkedIn profile and their desired next job. Your goal is to analyze this information deeply and design a web app that effectively showcases the person's skills and experiences to help them achieve their career goals.

First, carefully review the following information:

<linkedin_profile>
{{ENTER_YOUR_LINKEDIN_PROFILE_HERE_COPYPASTE_THE_WHOLE_PAGE}}
</linkedin_profile>

<desired_job>
{{DESCRIBE_YOUR_IDEAL_JOB}}
</desired_job>

Analyze the LinkedIn profile and desired job description in depth. Consider the person's skills, experiences, achievements, and how they align with their career goals. Think about the best way to present this information to potential employers or clients in the context of a personal web app.

Based on your analysis, determine the ideal format, layout, content structure, and story to tell that will drive the person's desired outcome forward. Consider the following aspects:

1. Overall theme and design that reflects the person's professional identity
2. Key sections to include (e.g., about, skills, projects, experience, education)
3. How to highlight the most relevant experiences and skills for the desired job
4. Potential interactive elements or unique features that could set the web app apart

Break down the development process into phases that an AI (V0) can complete in a single interaction, with testable outcomes for each phase. Your phases should cover:

1. Initial setup and basic structure
2. Core content implementation
3. Styling and responsive design
4. Interactive features and animations
5. Performance optimization and testing

For each phase, provide clear instructions and goals that the AI developer should follow. Remember that the stack to use will be Next, React, Tailwind CSS, with a preference for shadcn/ui components.

Throughout your plan, indicate where the AI should ask the user for additional resources, such as:

1. Professional headshot or profile picture
2. Project screenshots or demos
3. Testimonials or recommendations
4. Any additional media that could enhance the web app

Your final output should be a comprehensive plan, written as a new file at the top level, called "requirements.md" for building this personal web app, structured as follows:

<web_app_plan>
1. Overall Design and Content Strategy
   [Provide a summary of the proposed design, key sections, and content structure]

2. Development Phases
   [List each phase with clear instructions and goals for the AI developer, and a clear acceptance critiria that I can test as a user]

3. Required Resources
   [List the additional assets or resources the AI should request from the user]

4. Technical Considerations
   [Provide any specific technical guidelines or considerations for using Next, React, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components]

5. Final Checklist
   [Provide a checklist of key features and elements that should be included in the final web app]
</web_app_plan>

Ensure that your plan is detailed, actionable, and tailored to the specific individual based on their LinkedIn profile and desired job. The goal is to create a web app that effectively showcases their skills and experiences, positioning them as an ideal candidate for their desired role.
