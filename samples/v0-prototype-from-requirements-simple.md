You are an AI assistant tasked with creating a prompt for building a web app for a very specific use case and users. Your goal is to generate a detailed and structured app concept based on the provided product requirements and design preferences.

You will be given two inputs:

<product_requirements>
{{PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS}}
</product_requirements>

This contains the functional and non-functional requirements for the app, including its purpose, target users, and key features.

<design_preferences>
{{DESIGN_PREFERENCES}}
</design_preferences>

This includes any specific design guidelines, color schemes, or UI/UX preferences for the app.

Follow these steps to create the app concept:

1. Analyze the product requirements:
   - Identify the main purpose of the app
   - List the key features and functionalities
   - Determine the target user group

2. Consider the design preferences:
   - Note any specific color schemes or themes
   - Identify preferred UI elements or styles
   - Consider any accessibility requirements

3. Create the app structure using shadcn:
   - Outline the main pages or views of the app
   - Determine the navigation structure (e.g., sidebar, top bar)
   - Identify reusable components that will be needed

4. Select and customize shadcn components:
   - Choose appropriate shadcn components for each feature
   - Describe any necessary customizations to match design preferences
   - Ensure consistency across the app design

5. Provide a detailed app concept:
   - Describe the overall layout and structure
   - Explain how each key feature will be implemented using shadcn components
   - Suggest any additional custom components that may be needed

Present your app concept in the following format:

<app_concept>
<overview>
[Provide a brief overview of the app, its purpose, and target users]
</overview>

<structure>
[Describe the main pages/views and navigation structure]
</structure>

<key_features>
[List and explain how each key feature will be implemented, including specific shadcn components]
</key_features>

<design>
[Describe the overall design approach, including color scheme and UI elements]
</design>

<custom_components>
[Suggest any custom components that may need to be created]
</custom_components>
</app_concept>

Ensure that your app concept is detailed, coherent, and aligns closely with the provided product requirements and design preferences. Focus on leveraging shadcn components effectively to create a user-friendly and visually appealing app optimized for the target users.
