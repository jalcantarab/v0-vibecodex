# Implementation Notes for AI Coding Starter Kit

This document contains important guidelines, patterns, and methodologies that should be followed consistently across the project. It serves as a reference for all developers working on the AI Coding Starter Kit.

## Project Philosophy

The AI Coding Starter Kit is an open-source project designed to help beginners create real projects with AI assistance. Our design and communication should reflect:

- **Approachability**: Content should be welcoming and accessible to beginners
- **Community-focus**: Emphasize the open-source, collaborative nature of the project
- **Educational value**: Highlight learning opportunities and skill development
- **Practical application**: Focus on building real, usable projects

## Design Language

### Visual Style

- **Color palette**: Gradients from violet to cyan for emphasis, with subtle background gradients
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with larger, bolder headings and readable body text
- **Imagery**: Use illustrations and screenshots that demonstrate the building process
- **Components**: Use cards with subtle shadows and rounded corners for content grouping
- **Badges**: Use badges to highlight important information (e.g., "Open Source", "Popular")

### Tone and Voice

- **Conversational**: Use friendly, approachable language
- **Direct**: Be clear and concise in instructions and explanations
- **Encouraging**: Emphasize that users can build real projects regardless of coding experience
- **Community-oriented**: Reference the community and collaborative aspects of the project

## Layout Structure

### Standard Page Layout

All pages should follow this consistent layout structure:

\`\`\`jsx
<div className="flex flex-col min-h-screen">
 <div className="container py-10 max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
   {/* Page content */}
 </div>
</div>
\`\`\`

This structure ensures:
- Content is properly centered in the viewport
- Pages have consistent padding and margins
- The layout is responsive across different screen sizes

### Container Constraints

Use these container constraints consistently:
- `max-w-6xl` to limit the maximum width
- `mx-auto` to center the container
- Responsive padding with `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`

### Two-Column Layout

For pages with a sidebar (like project details and tool pages), use this grid structure:

\`\`\`jsx
<div className="grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-[2fr_1fr]">
 {/* Main content column */}
 <div className="space-y-6">
   {/* Content components */}
 </div>
 
 {/* Sidebar column */}
 <div className="space-y-6">
   {/* Sidebar components */}
 </div>
</div>
\`\`\`

This ensures:
- Proper spacing between columns
- Responsive behavior (stacks vertically on mobile)
- Consistent proportions (2:1 ratio between main content and sidebar)

## Component Patterns

### Card Components

When using Card components:
- Use consistent padding with `<CardHeader>` and `<CardContent>` components
- Maintain spacing between cards with `space-y-6` on the parent container
- For clickable cards, use `hover:bg-muted/50 transition-colors` for hover effects
- Consider using `backdrop-blur-sm` with semi-transparent backgrounds for a modern look

### Navigation Components

For phase navigation:
- Use the `<PhaseNavigation>` component for consistent styling
- Ensure it spans the full width of its container
- Add appropriate spacing with `mb-6` or similar

### Badge Components

Use badges to highlight important information:
- For open source indicators: `<Badge variant="outline" className="px-3 py-1 border-violet-200 bg-violet-100/50 text-violet-800">`
- For difficulty levels: `<Badge className="bg-cyan-600">Beginner</Badge>`
- For popularity: `<Badge className="bg-violet-600">Popular</Badge>`

## Visual Elements

### Gradients

Use gradients consistently:
- For text highlights: `bg-gradient-to-r from-cyan-500 to-violet-500 text-transparent bg-clip-text`
- For button backgrounds: `bg-gradient-to-r from-violet-600 to-violet-500 hover:from-violet-700 hover:to-violet-600`
- For section backgrounds: `bg-gradient-to-br from-violet-50 to-cyan-50 dark:from-violet-950/20 dark:to-cyan-950/20`

### Icons

- Use Lucide React icons consistently throughout the application
- Maintain consistent sizing (e.g., `h-4 w-4` for inline icons, `h-6 w-6` for feature icons)
- Use icons to enhance visual communication, not replace text

## Utility Classes

### Consistent Spacing

Use Tailwind's spacing utilities consistently:
- `space-y-6` for vertical spacing between components
- `gap-6` for grid and flex layouts
- `mb-6` for margin below headings and navigation elements

### Typography

Follow these typography patterns:
- Page titles: `text-3xl font-bold tracking-tighter sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl`
- Section headings: `text-xl font-semibold`
- Card titles: Use the `<CardTitle>` component
- Body text: Default text size with `text-muted-foreground` for secondary text

## Responsive Design

Ensure all pages are responsive:
- Use grid layouts with responsive column counts: `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`
- For two-column layouts, use `md:grid-cols-[2fr_1fr]` to stack on mobile
- Test all pages at mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints

## Tool Logo Display

When displaying tool logos:
- Use the `<ToolLogo>` component for consistent styling
- Pass the appropriate `toolId` and `size` props
- The component handles proper background and padding for each logo

## Community Elements

Highlight the open-source nature of the project:
- Include GitHub stars, license information, and contributor count
- Add links to GitHub repository and community platforms
- Use "Open Source" badges and callouts
- Emphasize community contributions and collaborative learning

## Future Considerations

As the project evolves, we'll add more sections to this document covering:
- State management patterns
- Form handling
- Authentication flows
- Data fetching strategies
- Animation guidelines
- Accessibility requirements
- Contribution guidelines
